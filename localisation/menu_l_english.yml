 1936_DESC:0 "January 1, 1936\n\nThe world has been ravaged by the horrors of the Great War and as a result, the Treaty of Versailles that led to the collapse of German society and eventually, the Great Depression, which plunged people into unemployment. In the already corrupt German society, this particularly led to the rise of the Nazis whose beliefs stood for anti-semitism, totalitarianism, and white supremacism. Similar parties had already taken charge in nations like Japan and Italy. However, in 1932, Hitler had the most seats in the German parliament and by 1934, had taken all of the responsibility over German politics and prepared the people for rearmament and their destiny.\n\nAs of now, the stability of Europe is dangling on a thread. Time will tell if the evermore ambitious Germany will cut it."
