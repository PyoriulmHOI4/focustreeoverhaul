 1936_NAME:0 "Gathering Storm"
 1936_DESC:0 "January 1, 1936\n\nThe world has been ravaged by the horrors of the Great War and as a result, the Treaty of Versailles that led to the collapse of German society and eventually, the Great Depression, which plunged people into unemployment. In the already corrupt German society, this particularly led to the rise of the Nazis whose beliefs stood for anti-semitism, totalitarianism, and white supremacism. Similar parties had already taken charge in nations like Japan and Italy. However, in 1932, Hitler had the most seats in the German parliament and by 1934, had taken all of the responsibility over German politics and prepared the people for rearmament and their destiny.\n\nAs of now, the stability of Europe is dangling on a thread. Time will tell if the evermore ambitious Germany will cut it."
 1939_NAME:0 "Blitzkreig"
 1939_DESC:0 "August 18, 1939\n\nThe sparks in nationalism across the world that have been lit by the Germans, Italians, and Japanese have proven to be some interesting developments. In the summer of 1936, Spain erupted into civil war between the communist and left-wing Republican faction versus the Falangist, right-wing Nationalist faction, with Franco and the Falange coming out of the conflict victorious. Britain and France officially signed a defensive pact and the latter joined the Allies. Meanwhile, in Central Europe, Adolf Hitler was able to annex Austria in the Anschluss and they annexed the ethnically German Sudetenland, eventually invading the rest of Czechoslovakia. They were also able to acquire the Memelland in the north from Lithuania and they fortified their western flank to divert a possible French invasion. In East Asia, yet another war has erupted between the Empire of Japan versus the Chinese warlords and factions, uniting under the Chinese United Front to prioritize the external threat by Hirohito.\n\nCurrently, with the new developments in Eastern Europe, things are not looking good for the world at all. A new pact between the Soviets and Germans to carve up Poland may see the map of Europe completely redrawn like the Entente had with Versailles."
