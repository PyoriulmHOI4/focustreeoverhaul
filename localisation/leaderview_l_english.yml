 GER_Adolf_Hitler_Desc:0 "Born in 1889 in the small town of Braunau-am-Inn, Austria, to an abusive father and overprotective mother, Adolf Hitler was expected to follow in his father’s footsteps and become a public official, and serve the Austro-Hungarian Empire in the ‘art’ of Bureaucracy. The young Adolf, however, had other plans, choosing to pursue the art of painting, and throughout his young years- perhaps spurred on by his hatred for his father- became an ardent Pan-Germanist. Following his father’s death to a severe lung hemorrhage brought on by a lifetime of smoking, the newly-independent Hitler left Braunau-am-Inn for Vienna, where he attempted to be accepted into the Vienna Academy of Fine Arts, but was rejected due to the board not liking his particular style of art.\n\nAfter his beloved mother died, he left Austria for Germany, and moved from poorhouse to poorhouse and alleyway to alleyway in destitution, creating new paintings whenever he could and selling them to anyone who would take them. When the Great War broke out, feeling a sense of duty to Germany born from his Pan-German ideals, he joined the Imperial German Army, and quickly distinguished himself on the battlefield, being awarded the Iron Cross not once, but twice in the course of the war. Following the war’s conclusion and the impositions of the Treaty of Versailles, Hitler was released from military duty.\n\nDetermined to continue serving Germany, Hitler joined the Reichswehr, and became an informant. He infiltrated various political organizations suspected to be dangerous, and gave information he collected to his superiors. One of these groups, the German Workers’ Party, would prove to be extremely influential on Adolf, their message- a mix of nationalism and socialism- proved to speak to Adolf in a way no other party had. He joined the party, and quickly became it’s face, speaking at every opportunity, his fiery, impassioned speeches drew crowds from every walk of life- but most especially the veterans of the Great War who felt betrayed by their government, and the workers who felt they had been disenfranchised and left to hang by the system. \n\nIn November of 1923, Hitler was arrested for leading an attempt to overthrow the Bavarian government in what came to be known as the ‘Bierhalle-Putsch’. At his sentencing, Hitler took the opportunity to give one of his famous speeches, which evidently won him the judge’s favour, as he was given only 5 years in jail- of which he only served only 8 months. He came back not only with a fury, but with a book he’d written in prison that outlined his personal beliefs, attitudes and vision for Germany; “Mein Kampf”- or, “My Struggle”-, which quickly became a nationwide hit in Germany. Hitler ousted the old party chair and took the reins for himself shortly thereafter, rebranding it to be the ‘National Socialist German Workers’ Party’, or NSDAP for short. Election after election, the NSDAP gained more momentum and took more seats until finally, in 1932, the NSDAP became the largest party in the Reichstag. President Paul von Hindenburg and Deputy Chancellor Franz von Papen, perhaps in an attempt to control Hitler and the NSDAP, invited him to form a government to oppose the left-wing coalitions already formed by the SPD, giving him the position of Chancellor in exchange for his agreement.\n\nWhatever their intentions, the pair clearly did not take into account Hitler’s ambition- or the state of President von Hindenburg’s health. On the 2nd of August, 1934, von Hindenburg died from untreated lung cancer, and Hitler seized the opportunity to expand his power and influence, taking the mantle of President for himself and ousting von Papen from his position as Deputy Chancellor. \n\nNow in near-total control of the German government, Hitler has taken the title of Führer and declared that Germany will be remade into a New Reich- an Empire to last a millennia. Only time will tell if Hitler’s dreams can be made into reality, but one thing is for certain; Europe is on the knife’s edge."
