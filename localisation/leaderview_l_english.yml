 Germany_Adolf_Hitler_Desc:0 "Born in 1889 in the small town of Braunau-am-Inn, Austria, to an abusive father and overprotective mother, Adolf Hitler was expected to follow in his father’s footsteps and become a public official, and serve the Austro-Hungarian Empire as a bureaucrat. The young Adolf, however, had other plans, choosing to pursue the art of painting, and throughout his youth- perhaps spurred on by his hatred for his father- became an ardent Pan-Germanist. Following his father’s death, the newly-independent Adolf left Braunau-am-Inn for Vienna, where he applied to the Vienna Academy of Fine Arts, but was rejected due to the board not liking his particular style of art.\n\nAfter his mother died, he left Austria for Germany, and moved from place to place in destitution, creating new paintings whenever he could and selling them to anyone who would take them. When the Great War broke out, feeling a sense of duty to Germany born from his Pan-German ideals, he joined the Imperial German Army, and quickly distinguished himself on the battlefield, being awarded the Iron Cross not once, but twice in the course of the war. Following the war’s conclusion, Adolf was released from military duty.\n\nDetermined to continue serving Germany, Adolf joined the Reichswehr, and became an informant. He infiltrated various political organizations suspected to be dangerous, and gave information he collected to his superiors. One of these groups, the National Socialist German Workers’ Party (‘NSDAP’, for short), would prove to be extremely influential on Adolf, their platform- nationalist anti-capitalism- proved to speak to Adolf in a way no other party had. He joined the party, and quickly became it’s face- his fiery, impassioned speeches drew crowds from every walk of life, but most especially those who felt used and betrayed.\n\nFollowing the release of Hitler’s book, ‘Mein Kampf’- which he wrote during his incarceration following the failed ‘Bierhalle-Putsch’ in Bavaria-, the NSDAP began to grow exponentially in power and popularity with each election, until finally reaching a critical mass in 1933- forcing the centre-right coalition led by President Paul von Hindenburg to make a deal with Hitler, granting him the German Chancellorship. Following President von Hindenburg’s untimely death in 1934, Hitler used his substantial influence to subsume the power and duties of the Presidency into the office of Chancellor.\n\nNow in near-total control of the German government following the passage of the ‘Enabling Acts’, Hitler has taken the title of Führer and declared that Germany will be remade into a New Reich- an Empire to last A Thousand Years. Only time will tell if Hitler’s dreams can be made into reality, but one thing is for certain; the world will never be the same."
