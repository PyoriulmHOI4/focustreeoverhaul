 Germany_Adolf_Hitler_Desc:0 "Magnitudo per bellum. Do you know what that is? It means "greatness through war."\n\nWith the collapse of German society following the treaty that made them suffer, the people looked up to something bigger. They wanted a stronger government and a more powerful state. One man gave it—or at least, tried to give it—his all. One man was everyone's savior, and he gave the nation what it needed. That man was Adolf Hitler.\n\nA German nationalist, Hitler moved to Munich and moved from place to place in an effort to sell paintings and designs. This was essentially his life until conflicts and tensions spiraled into all-out war across the continent. A pan-German, Adolf found himself not just a volunteer, but obligated to serve in the Great War and he proudly signed up for the German Imperial Army and fought in the trenches in France and Belgium. Throughout the war, he received multiple injuries but begged to keep fighting for Germany. In one of these hospitalizations, Hitler learned about the end of the war and was furious with the terms that the Treaty of Versailles enforced on the German nation, including a shrunken military and lost land.\n\nAfter the war, Hitler was still able to join the Reichswehr as an informant to infiltrate any parties that seemed to be waving any red flags for the government. One of these parties, the Deutsche Arbeiterpartei, was actually a right-wing party that spoke to the young Adolf clearer than any other political platform. He signed up for the party, climbed its ranks through his mad speeches and rants, and proved to be a symbol of the party. In 1923, he tried to orchestrate a coup but was arrested and while in prison, he wrote one his most famous writings, Mein Kampf, which showed his attitudes and political beliefs. Once released, he rebuilt the party from the ashes that it was and in 1932, his party had a majority in the Reichstag. Eventually, President Hindenburg’s coalition government struck a deal with Hitler, allowing him to be Chancellor.\n\nFortunately for Hitler, the government didn’t take in account of Hitler’s ambitions and Hindenburg’s untimely death in 1934. Once he died, Hitler took the chance to amass power for himself and allow the German government to succumb to him. Throughout the few years that Hitler has been Chancellor—now, Führer, he promised to make the German Reich last for a thousand years. Time will tell if he ends up being right."
